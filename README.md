# gis_course
Slides and code for courses on GIS methods. The ArcGIS and QGIS courses
were developed together with [Giorgio Chiovelli](https://sites.google.com/site/gchiovelli/).
The pure Python course was developed together with [Giorgio Chiovelli](https://sites.google.com/site/gchiovelli/)
and [Tanner Regan](https://sites.google.com/site/tannerregan).

We have three versions of the course
------------------------------------
- Our newest version using pure Python and a range of packages (mainly [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/)) is aimed at doctoral students in economics.
- An older version using [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), for which there are two courses. One is aimed at doctoral students, the other is aimed at business school students.
- The oldest version using [ArcGIS](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/) 10.X is aimed at doctoral students.

The last lecture of each doctoral course is an introduction to the [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/).

A special thanks to [Shaun R Levick](https://www.shaunlevick.com/) for
letting us re-use some of his material on the Google Earth Engine.
