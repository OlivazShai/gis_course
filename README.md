# gis_course
Slides and code for courses on GIS methods developed together with 
[Giorgio Chiovelli](https://sites.google.com/site/gchiovelli/).

We have a version of the course using ArcGIS 10.X and a version using QGIS.
The ArcGIS course is aimed at research students in economics. For QGIS, 
there are two courses. One is an almost one-to-one port of the ArcGIS
course for research students. The other is aimed at business school students.
The last lecture of the research course is an introduction to the Google 
Earth Engine.

A special thanks to [Shaun R Levick](https://www.shaunlevick.com/) for
letting us re-use some of his material on the Google Earth Engine.
